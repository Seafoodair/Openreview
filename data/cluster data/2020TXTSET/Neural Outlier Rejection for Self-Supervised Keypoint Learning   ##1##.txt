Generating reliable illumination and viewpoint invariant keypoints is critical for tasks such as feature-based SLAM and SfM. Recently, many learned keypoint methods have demonstrated improved performance on challenging benchmarks. However, it is extremely difficult to create consistent training samples for interest points in natural images, since they are hard to define clearly and consistently for a human annotator. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised learning scheme that can effectively exploit unlabeled data to provide more reliable keypoints under various scene conditions. Our key contributions are (i) a novel way of regressing keypoints, which avoids discretization errors introduced by related methods; (ii) a novel way of extracting associated descriptors by means of an upsampling step, which allows regressing the descriptors with a more fine-grained detail for the per-pixel level metric learning and (iii) a novel way of training the descriptor by using a proxy task, i.e. neural outlier rejection. By using this proxy task we can derive a fully self-supervised training loss for the descriptor, thus avoiding the need for manual annotation. We show that these three contributions greatly improve the quality of feature matching and homography estimation on challenging benchmarks over the state-of-the-art.
