Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by imperceptible perturbations. A range of defense techniques have been proposed to improve DNN robustness to adversarial examples, among which adversarial training has been demonstrated to be the most effective. Adversarial training is often formulated as a min-max optimization problem, with the inner maximization for generating adversarial examples. However, there exists a simple, yet easily overlooked fact that adversarial examples are only defined on correctly classified (natural) examples, but inevitably, some (natural) examples will be misclassified during training. In this paper, we investigate the distinctive influence of misclassified and correctly classified examples on the final robustness of adversarial training. Specifically, we find that misclassified examples indeed have a significant impact on the final robustness. More surprisingly, we find that different maximization techniques on misclassified examples may have a negligible influence on the final robustness, while different minimization techniques are crucial. Motivated by the above discovery, we propose a new defense algorithm called {em Misclassification Aware adveRsarial Training} (MART), which explicitly differentiates the misclassified and correctly classified examples during the training. We also propose a semi-supervised extension of MART, which can leverage the unlabeled data to further improve the robustness. Experimental results show that MART and its variant could significantly improve the state-of-the-art adversarial robustness. Robustness, Adversarial Defense, Adversarial Training
