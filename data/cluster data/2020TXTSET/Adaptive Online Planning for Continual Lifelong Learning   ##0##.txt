We study learning control in an online lifelong learning scenario, where mistakes can compound catastrophically into the future and the underlying dynamics of the environment may change. Traditional model-free policy learning methods have achieved successes in difficult tasks due to their broad flexibility, and capably condense broad experiences into compact networks, but struggle in this setting, as they can activate failure modes early in their lifetimes which are difficult to recover from and face performance degradation as dynamics change. On the other hand, model-based planning methods learn and adapt quickly, but require prohibitive levels of computational resources. Under constrained computation limits, the agent must allocate its resources wisely, which requires the agent to understand both its own performance and the current state of the environment  knowing that its mastery over control in the current dynamics is poor, the agent should dedicate more time to planning. We present a new algorithm, Adaptive Online Planning (AOP), that achieves strong performance in this setting by combining model-based planning with model-free learning. By measuring the performance of the planner and the uncertainty of the model-free components, AOP is able to call upon more extensive planning only when necessary, leading to reduced computation times. We show that AOP gracefully deals with novel situations, adapting behaviors and policies effectively in the face of unpredictable changes in the world -- challenges that a continual learning agent naturally faces over an extended lifetime -- even when traditional reinforcement learning methods fail. reinforcement learning, model predictive control, planning, model based, model free, uncertainty, computation
