In multi-agent systems, complex interacting behaviors arise due to heavy correlations among agents. However, prior works on modeling multi-agent interactions from demonstrations have largely been constrained by assuming the independence among policies and their reward structures. In this paper, we cast the multi-agent interactions modeling problem into a multi-agent imitation learning framework with explicit modeling of correlated policies by approximating opponents’ policies. Consequently, we develop a Decentralized Adversarial Imitation Learning algorithm with Correlated policies (CoDAIL), which allows for decentralized training and execution. Various experiments demonstrate that CoDAIL can better fit complex interactions close to the demonstrators and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-agent imitation learning methods.
