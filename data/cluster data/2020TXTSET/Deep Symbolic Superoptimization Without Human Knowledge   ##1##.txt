Deep symbolic superoptimization refers to the task of applying deep learning methods to simplify symbolic expressions. Existing approaches either perform supervised training on human-constructed datasets that defines equivalent expression pairs, or apply reinforcement learning with human-defined equivalent trans-formation actions. In short, almost all existing methods rely on human knowledge to define equivalence, which suffers from large labeling cost and learning bias, because it is almost impossible to define and comprehensive equivalent set. We thus propose HISS, a reinforcement learning framework for symbolic super-optimization that keeps human outside the loop. HISS introduces a tree-LSTM encoder-decoder network with attention to ensure tractable learning. Our experiments show that HISS can discover more simplification rules than existing human-dependent methods, and can learn meaningful embeddings for symbolic expressions, which are indicative of equivalence.
