Graph representation learning for hypergraphs can be utilized to extract patterns among higher-order interactions that are critically important in many real world problems. Current approaches designed for hypergraphs, however, are unable to handle different types of hypergraphs and are typically not generic for various learning tasks. Indeed, models that can predict variable-sized heterogeneous hyperedges have not been available. Here we develop a new self-attention based graph neural network called Hyper-SAGNN applicable to homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs with variable hyperedge sizes. We perform extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, including four benchmark network datasets and two single-cell Hi-C datasets in genomics. We demonstrate that Hyper-SAGNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on traditional tasks while also achieving great performance on a new task called outsider identification. We believe that Hyper-SAGNN will be useful for graph representation learning to uncover complex higher-order interactions in different applications. graph neural network, hypergraph, representation learning
