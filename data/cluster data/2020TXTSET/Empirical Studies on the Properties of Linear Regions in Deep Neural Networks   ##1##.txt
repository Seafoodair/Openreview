A deep neural networks (DNN) with piecewise linear activations can partition the input space into numerous small linear regions, where different linear functions are fitted. It is believed that the number of these regions represents the expressivity of a DNN. This paper provides a novel and meticulous perspective to look into DNNs  Instead of just counting the number of the linear regions, we study their local properties, such as the inspheres, the directions of the corresponding hyperplanes, the decision boundaries, and the relevance of the surrounding regions. We empirically observed that different optimization techniques lead to completely different linear regions, even though they result in similar classification accuracies. We hope our study can inspire the design of novel optimization techniques, and help discover and analyze the behaviors of DNNs. deep learning, linear region, optimization
