In this work, we develop the theory for analyzing the generalization performance of recurrent neural networks. We first present a new generalization bound for recurrent neural networks based on matrix-1 norm and Fisher-Rao norm. The definition of Fisher-Rao norm relies on a structural lemma about the gradient of RNNs. This new generalization bound assumes that the covariance matrix of the input data is positive definite, which might limit its use in practice. To address this issue, we propose to add random noise to the input data and prove a generalization bound for training with random noise, which is an extension of the former one. Compared with existing results, our generalization bounds have no explicit dependency on the size of networks. We also discover that Fisher-Rao norm for RNNs can be interpreted as a measure of gradient, and incorporating this gradient measure not only can tighten the bound, but allows us to build a relationship between generalization and trainability. Based on the bound, we analyze the effect of covariance of features on generalization of RNNs theoretically and discuss how weight decay and gradient clipping in the training can help improve generalization.
