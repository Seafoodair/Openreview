Adaptive gradient algorithms perform gradient-based updates using the history of gradients and are ubiquitous in training deep neural networks. While adaptive gradient methods theory is well understood for minimization problems, the underlying factors driving their empirical success in min-max problems such as GANs remain unclear. In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Theoretically, we develop an algorithm (Optimistic Stochastic Gradient, OSG) for solving a class of non-convex non-concave min-max problem and establish complexity for finding -first-order stationary point, in which only one stochastic first-order oracle is invoked in each iteration. An adaptive variant of the proposed algorithm (Optimistic Adagrad, OAdagrad) is also analyzed, revealing an emph{improved} adaptive complexity ~footnote{Here compresses a logarithmic factor of .}, where characterizes the growth rate of the cumulative stochastic gradient and . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for establishing adaptive complexity in non-convex non-concave min-max optimization. Empirically, our experiments show that indeed adaptive gradient algorithms outperform their non-adaptive counterparts in GAN training. Moreover, this observation can be explained by the slow growth rate of the cumulative stochastic gradient, as observed empirically. Generative Adversarial Nets, Adaptive Gradient Algorithms
